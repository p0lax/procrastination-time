# Flow time

### Motivation

Once upon a time I've found that application I've gotten used to dramatically changed interface and became inconvenient. So, I've started developing my own app and this way have found it a pretty interesting possibility to study working with sound in a browser

### What's it?

This is a small front-end application for tracking work activities and better immersion in a flow state via listening to some monotone sounds
