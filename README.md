# Flow time

### Motivation

Once upon a time I've found that application I've gotten used to dramatically changed interface and became inconvenient. So, I've started developing my own app and this way have found it a pretty interesting possibility to study working with sound in a browser

### What's it?

This is a small front-end application for tracking work activities and better immersion in a flow state via listening to some monotone sounds

### Tasks

- [x] Add predefined sounds of nature and city
- [x] Add background images and their animation
- [x] Add 25 minutes timer with CSS animation
- [x] Correct restarting of timer
- [ ] Make application installable to desctop and mobile
- [ ] Add end-time sounds
